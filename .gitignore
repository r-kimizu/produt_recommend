# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.

#  that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer, 
#  you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
